# Chess Game App

A simple web‑based Chess Game App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for game rules and logic and [chessboard.js](https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs) for a beautiful, interactive chessboard rendered in the browser.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Moves:** Easily move pieces with a click and drag interface.
- **Move Validation:** Legal moves are enforced automatically.
- **Responsive Design:** Play on any device with a modern browser.
- **Reset Functionality:** Start a new game at any time.
